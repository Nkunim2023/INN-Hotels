<h2>Business Problem Overview and Solution Approach</h2>
<p>INN Hotels Group has a chain of hotels in Portugal. They are facing problems with the high number
of booking cancellations. <p />
<p>A significant number of hotel bookings are called off due to cancellations or no-shows. The typical
reasons for cancellations include change of plans, scheduling conflicts, etc. This is often made easier
by the option to do so free of charge or preferably at a low cost which is beneficial to hotel guests
but it is a less desirable and possibly revenue-diminishing factor for hotels to deal with. Such losses
are particularly high on last-minute cancellations.</p>
<p>The new technologies involving online booking channels have dramatically changed customersâ€™
booking possibilities and behavior.</p>
<p>The task at hand is to analyze the data provided, to find which factors have a high influence on
booking cancellations, build a predictive model that can predict which booking is going to be
canceled in advance, and help in formulating profitable policies for cancellations and refunds.</p>
